# Prediction_model_iplmatches
In my even semester of MBA I have done a project I have made a prediction model for IPL matches, In India, there is a professional Twenty20 cricket league called the Indian Premier League (IPL). The association was established in 2008 by the Leading body of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) with eight groups. The IPL is currently one of the most well known cricket associations on the planet, with a tremendous fan following. In this examination, I utilize a dataset of IPL matches from 2008 to 2021 to acquire bits of knowledge into different elements that impact the result of a match. Teams, toss winners, match winners, and other pertinent data are included in the dataset. And I also used this dataset to make my prediction model, Key Skills that I have learned after the compilation of this project is:
Predictive Analytics, Data Visualization, Data analyst, Data Pre-processing, Modeling,Evaluation.
